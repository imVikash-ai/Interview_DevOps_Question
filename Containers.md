# **Containers & Kubernetes - DevOps Interview Questions (250 Questions)**

---

### **1. What is a Container and how does it fundamentally differ from a Virtual Machine?**
**Answer:** A container is a software package that bundles an application's code with its libraries and dependencies, so the same code runs consistently on any machine. It virtualizes the operating system, and a container engine (such as Docker) manages it.

A Virtual Machine is a digital copy of a physical machine. It runs its own full guest OS on top of a host, with a hypervisor sharing the hardware between VMs.

Key differences:

Virtualization: Containers virtualize the OS. VMs virtualize the physical hardware.

Size: Containers are lightweight, measured in MBs, because they package only what one application needs. VMs are heavy, measured in GBs, because each includes a full OS.

Speed and scaling: Containers are quick to build, change and scale, and they suit microservices. VMs are slower to rebuild and costlier to scale.

Control: VMs give more control over the whole environment. Containers are static and portable, so they move easily between on-premises and cloud.

### **2. Explain the 7 Linux Namespaces that provide container isolation.**
**Answer:**
1. **PID (Process ID):** Isolates the process tree (container sees its main process as PID 1).
2. **NET (Networking):** Isolates network devices, IP routing tables, port numbers, and firewall rules.
3. **MNT (Mount):** Isolates filesystem mount points (container sees its own root filesystem).
4. **IPC (Inter-Process Communication):** Isolates POSIX message queues and shared memory segments.
5. **UTS (UNIX Timesharing System):** Isolates hostname and domain name.
6. **USER (User IDs):** Maps UID/GID inside the container to different UIDs on the host (e.g., container root UID 0 maps to unprivileged host UID 10001).
7. **CGROUP (Control Group):** Isolates cgroup root hierarchy visibility.

### **3. What are Linux cgroups (Control Groups) and what is the difference between cgroups v1 and cgroups v2?**
**Answer:** cgroups enforce resource allocation and limits (CPU, memory, disk I/O, PIDs) for process groups.
- **cgroups v1:** Had separate, uncoordinated resource hierarchies for each controller (cpu, memory, blkio). Memory controller could not track buffered writeback I/O.
- **cgroups v2 (Modern Standard):** Unified single-hierarchy architecture, unified page cache and memory pressure tracking, robust out-of-memory (OOM) handling, and rootless container resource delegation.

### **4. Explain the Container Runtime Hierarchy (High-Level vs Low-Level Runtimes).**
**Answer:**
- **High-Level Runtimes (CRI Runtimes):** Manage container lifecycle, pull images from registries, unpack filesystems, and configure networks (e.g., **containerd**, **CRI-O**).
- **Low-Level Runtimes (OCI Runtimes):** Interact directly with the Linux kernel to create namespaces, set up cgroups, and spawn the container process (e.g., **runc**, **crun**, **youki**).

### **5. What is the Open Container Initiative (OCI)?**
**Answer:** An open governance project under the Linux Foundation that establishes standardized specifications:
1. **Image Spec:** Defines the archive format, manifest JSON, and layer serialization for container images.
2. **Runtime Spec:** Defines the configuration (`config.json`) and lifecycle operations (`create`, `start`, `kill`, `delete`) for running containers.
3. **Distribution Spec:** Defines the standard HTTP API for pushing and pulling images from OCI registries.

### **6. What is `runc`?**
**Answer:** The reference implementation of the OCI runtime specification. It is a lightweight CLI wrapper written in Go that configures Linux kernel namespaces and cgroups to execute a container process and then exits.

### **7. What is `containerd` and what is `containerd-shim`?**
**Answer:** `containerd` is an industry-standard core container runtime managing image transfer, storage, and execution. The `containerd-shim` is a lightweight daemon that sits between containerd and `runc`. It stays alive to maintain open standard I/O (stdin/stdout/stderr) streams and exit codes without keeping the main containerd daemon attached, enabling daemon restarts with zero container downtime.

### **8. What is CRI-O?**
**Answer:** A lightweight, purpose-built Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface (CRI) runtime developed specifically for Kubernetes, running OCI-compliant containers directly without any Docker or third-party overhead.

### **9. What are Sandboxed Container Runtimes (e.g., gVisor, Kata Containers)?**
**Answer:**
- **gVisor (`runsc`):** An application kernel written in Go that runs in userspace, intercepting and implementing Linux system calls to provide a strong security boundary between the container and host kernel.
- **Kata Containers:** Runs each container inside its own lightweight hardware-isolated microVM (using QEMU or Cloud Hypervisor) with its own guest kernel.

### **10. What is an Overlay Filesystem (Overlay2)?**
**Answer:** A union mount filesystem that combines multiple directory layers into a single unified view:
- **LowerDir (Read-Only):** The immutable image layers.
- **UpperDir (Read-Write):** The ephemeral container layer where modifications are made.
- **WorkDir:** Internal scratch space used for atomic copy-up operations.
- **MergedDir:** The unified filesystem presented to the container.

### **11. What is Copy-on-Write (CoW) in Docker?**
**Answer:** A strategy where files in underlying read-only image layers are shared across all containers. When a container attempts to modify a file, the storage driver copies the file from the lower layer up to the upper read-write layer before modifying it, saving storage and memory.

### **12. What is a Multi-Stage Dockerfile and why is it mandatory for production?**
**Answer:** A Dockerfile containing multiple `FROM` instructions. The first stage contains heavy compilers, SDKs, and build tools; subsequent stages copy *only* the compiled binary into a minimal runtime base image (e.g., Distroless or Alpine), reducing image size from 1GB to $< 30\text{MB}$ and eliminating build-time security vulnerabilities.

### **13. What are Distroless Images (Google)?**
**Answer:** Container base images containing *only* the application binary and its direct runtime dependencies. They contain **zero package managers, zero shells (`/bin/sh`, `/bin/bash`), and zero OS utilities**, drastically reducing attack surfaces and CVE counts.

### **14. What is the difference between `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` in a Dockerfile?**
**Answer:**
- **`ENTRYPOINT`:** Defines the core executable binary that will always run when the container starts.
- **`CMD`:** Provides default arguments passed to the `ENTRYPOINT`. `CMD` can be easily overridden via CLI arguments (`docker run image arg1`), whereas `ENTRYPOINT` requires `--entrypoint`.

### **15. Explain `CMD ["node", "server.js"]` (Exec Form) vs `CMD node server.js` (Shell Form).**
**Answer:**
- **Exec Form (JSON Array):** Spawns the binary directly as **PID 1**. Receives Unix signals (`SIGTERM`, `SIGINT`) properly for graceful shutdown.
- **Shell Form:** Wraps the command in `/bin/sh -c`. The shell becomes PID 1 and typically swallows `SIGTERM`, preventing the application from draining connections and causing abrupt kills (`SIGKILL`).

### **16. What is Rootless Docker / Rootless Podman?**
**Answer:** Running the container daemon and container processes inside an unprivileged user namespace without host `root` privileges. If a container breakout exploit occurs, the attacker gains only unprivileged user permissions on the host OS.

### **17. What are Docker Capabilities (`CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, `CAP_NET_ADMIN`)?**
**Answer:** Fine-grained privileges breaking down the monolithic power of Linux root. By default, Docker drops dangerous capabilities; DevOps engineers should drop all capabilities (`--cap-drop=ALL`) and explicitly add only what is strictly required (`--cap-add=NET_BIND_SERVICE`).

### **18. Why is running containers with `--privileged` dangerous?**
**Answer:** `--privileged` grants the container access to all host devices, disables AppArmor/SELinux security profiles, and gives the container full host root capabilities, making container escapes trivial.

### **19. What is a Zombie Process (Defunct Process) in containers?**
**Answer:** A child process that has completed execution but remains in the process table because its parent process did not read its exit status (`wait()` syscall). If PID 1 inside the container does not reap orphaned child processes, the PID table exhausts, crashing the host.

### **20. What is `tini` / `dumb-init`?**
**Answer:** Lightweight init systems designed to run as PID 1 inside containers to properly forward Unix signals (`SIGTERM`) to child processes and reap zombie processes.

### **21. What is Docker BuildKit?**
**Answer:** The modern container build engine in Docker providing concurrent multi-stage builds, remote cache export/import, secret mounting without committing secrets to layers (`RUN --mount=type=secret`), and SSH forwarding.

### **22. What is Multi-Architecture Building (`docker buildx`)?**
**Answer:** Using QEMU emulation and binfmt_misc to compile and package container images for multiple CPU architectures (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `linux/riscv64`) into a single multi-arch manifest list.

### **23. What is an OCI Image Manifest and Manifest List?**
**Answer:**
- **Manifest:** A JSON document specifying the config hash, media types, and layer digests that compose an image.
- **Manifest List (Index):** A higher-level JSON document mapping different CPU architectures/OS combinations to their specific image manifests under a single unified tag.

### **24. Compare Docker Bridge vs Host vs None Network Modes.**
**Answer:**
- **Bridge (Default):** Creates a private virtual Ethernet bridge (`docker0`) on the host; containers get private IPs and communicate via NAT/port forwarding.
- **Host:** Container shares the host network namespace directly with zero network isolation (no port mapping needed, maximum throughput).
- **None:** Container has no network interface except loopback (`lo`), completely air-gapped.

### **25. What is Docker Swarm vs Kubernetes?**
**Answer:** Docker Swarm is Docker's native clustering tool—simple to set up but limited in advanced routing, autoscaling, and ecosystem integrations. Kubernetes is the industry-standard container orchestrator offering declarative reconciliation, service discovery, auto-scaling, complex storage, and extensive extension APIs.

### **26. What is a Container Healthcheck (`HEALTHCHECK`)?**
**Answer:** An instruction in a Dockerfile defining a command (e.g., `curl -f http://localhost:8080/healthz || exit 1`) run periodically by the container engine to determine if the internal application process is healthy.

### **27. What is Docker Volume vs Bind Mount vs tmpfs?**
**Answer:**
- **Volume:** Managed by Docker on the host storage (`/var/lib/docker/volumes/`), isolated from the host filesystem.
- **Bind Mount:** Mounts any arbitrary file or directory from the host OS into the container.
- **tmpfs Mount:** Mounts temporary storage directly in host memory (RAM), never written to disk.

### **28. What is Docker Compose?**
**Answer:** A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using a declarative YAML configuration file (`docker-compose.yml`).

### **29. What is Kaniko?**
**Answer:** An open-source tool developed by Google that builds container images from a Dockerfile inside a Kubernetes pod or container without requiring a Docker daemon or privileged root access.

### **30. What is Buildah vs Podman vs Skopeo?**
**Answer:**
- **Buildah:** Specializes in building OCI container images without a daemon.
- **Podman:** A daemonless container engine for running and managing OCI containers, pods, and images.
- **Skopeo:** A CLI utility for inspecting, copying, and signing container images directly between remote registries without downloading them locally.

### **31. How do you pass secrets to Docker builds without exposing them in image history?**
**Answer:** Use BuildKit secret mounts: `RUN --mount=type=secret,id=mysecret cat /run/secrets/mysecret`. Secrets are mounted into memory during build time and are never stored in any image layer.

### **32. What is Image Layer Caching in Docker?**
**Answer:** Docker caches the result of each Dockerfile instruction. If an instruction and its preceding steps are unchanged, Docker reuses the cached layer. Instructions that change frequently (e.g., `COPY . .`) must be placed at the bottom of the Dockerfile.

### **33. What is `.dockerignore` and why is it critical?**
**Answer:** A file that excludes files and directories (`node_modules`, `.git`, `.env`, build logs) from being sent to the Docker daemon as part of the build context, drastically speeding up builds and preventing secret leaks.

### **34. What is Container Storage Interface (CSI)?**
**Answer:** An industry-standard interface specification that allows third-party storage providers (AWS EBS, Ceph, NetApp) to write plugins for block and file storage systems in Kubernetes without modifying core Kubernetes code.

### **35. What is Container Network Interface (CNI)?**
**Answer:** A CNCF specification and library providing a standardized interface for configuring network interfaces, IP addresses, and routing in Linux containers and Kubernetes pods (e.g., Calico, Cilium, AWS VPC CNI).

### **36. What is Container Runtime Interface (CRI)?**
**Answer:** A Kubernetes API interface allowing the `kubelet` to communicate with heterogeneous container runtimes (containerd, CRI-O) over gRPC without recompiling Kubernetes binaries.

### **37. What is Distroless vs Alpine Linux base images?**
**Answer:** Alpine uses `musl libc` and the `apk` package manager (can cause subtle C-extension bugs with Python/Node). Distroless uses `glibc` directly from Debian with zero shell or package manager, offering better compatibility and minimal attack surfaces.

### **38. What is Podman Quadlet?**
**Answer:** A systemd generator in Podman that translates declarative container configuration files into native `systemd` service units, managing containers as standard Linux system services.

### **39. What is a Docker Context?**
**Answer:** A mechanism that allows switching the target Docker CLI engine between different endpoints (e.g., local daemon, remote SSH server, AWS ECS).

### **40. What is Docker Content Trust (DCT)?**
**Answer:** A system utilizing digital signatures to verify the publisher and integrity of container images pulled from registries using Notary.

### **41. What is an OCI Artifact?**
**Answer:** Any non-container file type (Helm charts, WebAssembly modules, OPA policies, SBOMs) packaged and stored in standard OCI container registries using OCI specifications.

### **42. What is Docker Scout / Trivy?**
**Answer:** Container security and vulnerability analysis tools that analyze image layers, detect CVEs in OS packages and language dependencies, and provide remediation suggestions.

### **43. What is `cgroups.json` / `config.json` in OCI?**
**Answer:** The declarative specification consumed by `runc` defining namespaces, mounts, capabilities, process arguments, and resource limits to spawn a container.

### **44. What is a Flatpak vs Snap vs Docker Container?**
**Answer:** Flatpak and Snap are desktop application sandbox distribution formats; Docker containers are optimized for headless server processes and microservices with standardized OCI specs.

### **45. What is a Fork Bomb in containers and how is it prevented?**
**Answer:** A malicious process repeatedly spawning infinite child processes to exhaust the kernel PID table. Prevented using cgroups PID limits (`--pids-limit 100` or Kubernetes `podPidsLimit`).

### **46. What is Memory Swappiness in containers?**
**Answer:** A Linux kernel parameter (`--memory-swappiness`) controlling how aggressively the kernel swaps container anonymous memory pages to disk under memory pressure.

### **47. What is OOMKilled (Exit Code 137)?**
**Answer:** The Linux kernel Out-Of-Memory Killer terminating the container process when its physical memory usage exceeds the assigned cgroup memory limit (`limits.memory`).

### **48. What is CPU CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler) Throttling?**
**Answer:** The kernel enforcing container CPU limits over a period (usually 100ms). If a container exhausts its allocated quota within the first 20ms, it is throttled (frozen) for the remaining 80ms, causing severe latency spikes.

### **49. What is `seccomp` (Secure Computing Mode)?**
**Answer:** A Linux kernel security facility that filters the system calls a container process is allowed to make to the kernel, blocking dangerous syscalls (e.g., `reboot`, `ptrace`).

### **50. What is AppArmor / SELinux for containers?**
**Answer:** Mandatory Access Control (MAC) kernel security modules that enforce granular filesystem and process permission profiles on containers regardless of user privileges.

### **51. What is `docker system prune`?**
**Answer:** A CLI command that cleans up unused Docker data: stopped containers, dangling images, unused build caches, and networks.

### **52. What is a Docker Plugin?**
**Answer:** An out-of-process extension that adds capabilities to the Docker daemon (custom network drivers, volume drivers, logging drivers).

### **53. What is `iptables` in Docker?**
**Answer:** The Linux firewall utility Docker configures to route packets between physical interfaces and virtual bridge interfaces (`docker0`), performing Network Address Translation (NAT).

### **54. What is Docker daemon (`dockerd`)?**
**Answer:** The persistent background process that manages Docker objects (images, containers, networks, volumes) and listens for Docker REST API requests.

### **55. What is a Container Image Digest?**
**Answer:** An immutable, content-addressable SHA256 cryptographic hash of the image manifest (e.g., `image@sha256:abcd...`), guaranteeing identical image bits regardless of mutable tag changes.

### **56. What is Layer Invalidation in Dockerfile?**
**Answer:** When an instruction in a Dockerfile changes, Docker invalidates the cache for that instruction and forces all subsequent instructions to execute from scratch.

### **57. What is Docker Socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`)?**
**Answer:** The UNIX domain socket used by the Docker CLI to communicate with the Docker daemon. Mounting this socket into a container grants that container full root control over the host Docker daemon.

### **58. What is Container Attestation?**
**Answer:** Cryptographically signed statements attached to container images verifying their build provenance, test results, and vulnerability scanning compliance.

### **59. What is `cri-dockerd`?**
**Answer:** An adapter shim that allows Kubernetes to continue using the legacy Docker Engine as a CRI runtime after Kubernetes removed built-in `dockershim`.

### **60. What is Firecracker MicroVM?**
**Answer:** An open-source virtualization technology developed by AWS that creates lightweight, secure microVMs in sub-5 milliseconds with minimal memory footprint, powering AWS Lambda and Fargate.

## 🟡 **Part 2: Kubernetes Core Architecture & Control Plane (Questions 61–140)**

### **61. What are the core components of the Kubernetes Master / Control Plane?**
**Answer:**
1. **`kube-apiserver`:** The centralized REST API gateway and validation hub; the only component that communicates with `etcd`.
2. **`etcd`:** The distributed, highly consistent key-value store holding the entire cluster state.
3. **`kube-scheduler`:** Assigns unscheduled Pods to optimal worker nodes based on resource requests, affinity, taints, and topology.
4. **`kube-controller-manager`:** Runs core reconciliation control loops (Node Lifecycle, Deployment, ReplicaSet, ServiceAccount controllers).
5. **`cloud-controller-manager`:** Integrates with underlying cloud provider APIs for Load Balancers, Route tables, and Block Volumes.

### **62. What are the core components of a Kubernetes Worker Node?**
**Answer:**
1. **`kubelet`:** The node agent that communicates with the API server, watches PodSpecs assigned to the node, and commands the CRI runtime to start containers.
2. **`kube-proxy`:** Manages network routing and iptables/IPVS packet filtering rules on each node to implement Kubernetes `Service` abstractions.
3. **Container Runtime (CRI):** The runtime (containerd/CRI-O) executing container processes.

### **63. Explain `etcd` internals and how it maintains data consistency.**
**Answer:** `etcd` is an append-only distributed key-value store implementing the **Raft consensus algorithm**. It requires an odd number of nodes (3 or 5) to form a quorum ($\lfloor N/2 \rfloor + 1$). It writes updates to a Write-Ahead Log (WAL) before committing to memory, providing linearizable reads and strict serializability.

### **64. What is a Kubernetes Pod?**
**Answer:** The smallest deployable computing unit in Kubernetes. A Pod encapsulates one or more co-located containers that share the exact same Network namespace (IP address and port space), IPC namespace, and shared storage volumes.

### **65. What is the Pause Container (`infra` container)?**
**Answer:** A minimal container running an infinite sleep loop spawned first in every Pod. It establishes and holds the shared Network, IPC, and UTS namespaces. Application containers join the pause container's namespaces (`--net=container:pause`), allowing containers in the pod to communicate over `localhost`.

### **66. What is a Kubernetes Deployment vs ReplicaSet vs Pod?**
**Answer:**
- **Pod:** The running instance of containers.
- **ReplicaSet:** Ensures a specified number of identical Pod replicas are running at any given time.
- **Deployment:** A higher-level controller managing declarative rolling updates, rollbacks, and version history for ReplicaSets.

### **67. What is a StatefulSet and how does it differ from a Deployment?**
**Answer:** StatefulSet manages stateful applications requiring:
1. Stable, unique network identifiers (`pod-0`, `pod-1`).
2. Ordered, sequential deployment and rolling updates.
3. Dedicated, persistent volume bindings via `volumeClaimTemplates` that persist across pod rescheduling.

### **68. What is a DaemonSet?**
**Answer:** Ensures that all (or selected) worker nodes run exactly one copy of a specific Pod. Used for node-level agents (Cilium CNI, Fluent Bit log shippers, Prometheus `node_exporter`).

### **69. What is a Kubernetes Job vs CronJob?**
**Answer:**
- **Job:** Spawns one or more pods and ensures a specified number of them terminate successfully (run-to-completion batch tasks).
- **CronJob:** Schedules and executes `Job` objects periodically based on a standard cron expression.

### **70. Explain Kubernetes Service Types (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalName).**
**Answer:**
- **ClusterIP (Default):** Exposes the Service on an internal cluster IP, accessible *only* within the cluster.
- **NodePort:** Exposes the Service on a static high port (`30000-32767`) on every worker node's physical IP.
- **LoadBalancer:** Provisions an external cloud load balancer (e.g., AWS NLB/ALB) and routes traffic to NodePort/ClusterIP.
- **ExternalName:** Maps the Service to a CNAME DNS record (e.g., `my-db.external.com`) without proxying.

### **71. What is a Headless Service (`clusterIP: None`)?**
**Answer:** A Service that does not allocate a ClusterIP. CoreDNS returns the individual `A` records of all backing Pod IPs directly, allowing clients to establish direct peer-to-peer connections (used for StatefulSets, Kafka, and Cassandra).

### **72. What is Kubernetes Ingress vs Ingress Controller?**
**Answer:**
- **Ingress:** A declarative API resource defining Layer 7 HTTP/HTTPS routing rules, TLS termination, and host/path routing.
- **Ingress Controller:** The actual reverse proxy daemon (Nginx Ingress, Envoy, Traefik) that watches Ingress resources and configures routing rules.

### **73. What is Kubernetes Gateway API?**
**Answer:** The modern successor to Ingress providing role-oriented resource separation:
- `GatewayClass` (Cluster Operator defines infrastructure).
- `Gateway` (Platform Engineer configures listeners, ports, TLS).
- `HTTPRoute` / `GRPCRoute` (Developer defines routing paths and traffic splitting).

### **74. Explain Kubernetes Namespaces and their isolation boundaries.**
**Answer:** Virtual clusters within a physical cluster providing logical scoping for object names, RBAC policies, and ResourceQuotas. Namespaces do **not** provide network isolation by default (requires NetworkPolicies).

### **75. What is a ConfigMap vs a Secret?**
**Answer:**
- **ConfigMap:** Stores non-confidential configuration data in key-value pairs mounted as environment variables or volume files.
- **Secret:** Stores sensitive data (passwords, tokens, keys) encoded in base64. Stored encrypted at rest in `etcd` when KMS encryption is enabled.

### **76. What is a PersistentVolume (PV) vs PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)?**
**Answer:**
- **PV:** A storage resource provisioned in the cluster (e.g., AWS EBS volume) by an administrator or StorageClass.
- **PVC:** A request for storage by a user specifying size and access modes (`ReadWriteOnce`, `ReadOnlyMany`, `ReadWriteMany`).

### **77. What is Dynamic Volume Provisioning (StorageClass)?**
**Answer:** A mechanism where Kubernetes automatically provisions underlying cloud storage volumes (e.g., creates an AWS gp3 volume via CSI) on-demand when a developer creates a PVC referencing a `StorageClass`.

### **78. Explain Kubernetes Storage Access Modes.**
**Answer:**
- **RWO (ReadWriteOnce):** Volume can be mounted as read-write by a single worker node.
- **ROX (ReadOnlyMany):** Volume can be mounted as read-only by multiple worker nodes simultaneously.
- **RWX (ReadWriteMany):** Volume can be mounted as read-write by many worker nodes concurrently (e.g., AWS EFS, NFS).
- **RWOP (ReadWriteOncePod):** Volume can be mounted as read-write by a single Pod instance only.

### **79. What is a Kubernetes ServiceAccount (SA)?**
**Answer:** An identity assigned to Pods to authenticate against the Kubernetes API Server. Tokens are mounted automatically at `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`.

### **80. Explain Kubernetes RBAC: Role vs ClusterRole, RoleBinding vs ClusterRoleBinding.**
**Answer:**
- **Role:** Grants API permissions (verbs: `get`, `list`, `create`) scoped strictly to a single namespace.
- **ClusterRole:** Grants cluster-wide permissions across all namespaces and cluster-scoped resources (Nodes, PVs).
- **RoleBinding:** Assigns a Role or ClusterRole to subjects within a specific namespace.
- **ClusterRoleBinding:** Assigns a ClusterRole to subjects cluster-wide.

### **81. What is an Admission Controller?**
**Answer:** Plugins that intercept API Server requests after authentication and authorization, but *before* the object is persisted to `etcd`.
- **Mutating Admission Controllers:** Modify objects (e.g., injecting sidecars).
- **Validating Admission Controllers:** Enforce security policies and accept or reject objects (e.g., Kyverno, OPA).

### **82. Explain the difference between Liveness, Readiness, and Startup Probes.**
**Answer:**
- **Startup Probe:** Validates if legacy slow-booting applications have started. Disables liveness and readiness checks until it passes.
- **Liveness Probe:** Checks if the application process is running and healthy. If it fails, `kubelet` restarts the container.
- **Readiness Probe:** Checks if the container is ready to accept incoming network traffic. If it fails, the Pod's IP is removed from Service endpoints.

### **83. What are Init Containers?**
**Answer:** Specialized containers that run and complete sequentially *before* primary application containers start. Used for blocking tasks (waiting for database availability, running migrations).

### **84. What are Ephemeral Containers?**
**Answer:** Temporary containers injected into existing running Pods for interactive debugging and network troubleshooting (`kubectl debug`) without restarting the Pod.

### **85. What is a Pod Disruption Budget (PDB)?**
**Answer:** A policy limiting the number of Pod replicas of an application that can be unavailable simultaneously during voluntary disruptions (node draining, cluster upgrades).

### **86. What are Resource Requests vs Limits?**
**Answer:**
- **Requests:** The guaranteed minimum CPU and memory allocated for the Pod. Used by `kube-scheduler` to place the Pod on a node.
- **Limits:** The hard upper bound of CPU and memory the Pod is allowed to consume. CPU exceeding limits causes CFS throttling; memory exceeding limits triggers OOMKill.

### **87. What are Kubernetes Quality of Service (QoS) Classes?**
**Answer:**
1. **Guaranteed:** Every container has equal CPU and Memory Requests and Limits. Evicted last during resource exhaustion.
2. **Burstable:** Requests are set and lower than Limits. Evicted when Guaranteed pods require resources.
3. **BestEffort:** Zero requests and limits set. Evicted first during node memory pressure.

### **88. What is Node Affinity and Anti-Affinity?**
**Answer:**
- **Node Affinity:** Constrains which nodes a Pod can schedule on based on node labels (`requiredDuringScheduling...` or `preferredDuringScheduling...`).
- **Pod Anti-Affinity:** Prevents multiple replicas of the same service from scheduling on the same node or AZ to ensure high availability.

### **89. What are Taints and Tolerations?**
**Answer:**
- **Taint:** Applied to a **Node** to repel Pods (`key=value:NoSchedule`, `NoExecute`).
- **Toleration:** Applied to a **Pod** allowing it to schedule on matching tainted nodes (e.g., scheduling GPU workloads on dedicated GPU nodes).

### **90. What is Topology Spread Constraints?**
**Answer:** Rules that control how Pods are evenly spread across failure domains (Availability Zones, racks, nodes) based on label selectors (`maxSkew: 1`).

### **91. What is the Kubelet Eviction Manager?**
**Answer:** A proactive subsystem in kubelet that monitors node memory, disk, and PID usage. When thresholds are breached (`memory.available < 100Mi`), it evicts lower-priority pods to prevent node failure.

### **92. What is PriorityClass and Preemption?**
**Answer:** Defines the relative importance of Pods (`value: 1000000`). If a high-priority Pod cannot schedule due to lack of resources, the scheduler preempts (evicts) lower-priority pods to free up capacity.

### **93. What is a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)?**
**Answer:** A control loop that automatically adjusts the number of Pod replicas in a Deployment based on observed CPU/memory utilization or custom external metrics.

### **94. What is a Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)?**
**Answer:** A controller that automatically recommends or updates CPU and memory resource requests/limits based on historical runtime analysis.

### **95. What is KEDA (Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling)?**
**Answer:** An autoscaler that scales Kubernetes workloads from 0 to hundreds based on external event sources (Kafka consumer lag, AWS SQS queues, RabbitMQ, Prometheus metrics).

### **96. What is Karpenter?**
**Answer:** An open-source, high-performance node autoscaler developed by AWS that bypasses native Auto Scaling Groups, provisioning right-sized EC2 instances directly via EC2 Fleet API in seconds.

### **97. What is Karpenter Node Consolidation?**
**Answer:** An automated feature where Karpenter continuously evaluates cluster compute waste, drains pods from underutilized nodes, and replaces them with cheaper, right-sized single instances.

### **98. What is Cluster Autoscaler (CA)?**
**Answer:** A traditional autoscaler that adds or removes worker nodes by modifying the desired capacity of underlying cloud Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) when Pods enter `Pending` state.

### **99. What is CoreDNS in Kubernetes?**
**Answer:** The internal DNS server running as a cluster service that resolves internal service names (`my-svc.my-ns.svc.cluster.local`) and external domains for Pods.

### **100. What is NodeLocal DNSCache?**
**Answer:** A DaemonSet that runs a local DNS caching agent on each worker node, reducing CoreDNS network queries, UDP packet drops, and glibc `ndots:5` latency storms.

### **101. What is the Kubernetes Endpoints vs EndpointSlice API?**
**Answer:**
- **Endpoints:** A monolithic object tracking all pod IPs backing a service; updating 1 pod in a 5,000-pod service rewritten the entire object, overloading etcd.
- **EndpointSlice:** Splits backing pod endpoints into scalable chunks of 100 endpoints each, vastly improving cluster scalability.

### **102. What is `kube-proxy` IPVS mode vs iptables mode?**
**Answer:**
- **iptables:** Linear sequential rule evaluation ($O(N)$). As services reach thousands, packet processing latency degrades significantly.
- **IPVS (IP Virtual Server):** Linux kernel hash table lookup ($O(1)$). Provides consistent sub-millisecond throughput regardless of service scale.

### **103. What is Cilium eBPF CNI?**
**Answer:** A next-generation CNI plugin that replaces `kube-proxy` and iptables with eBPF programs loaded directly into Linux kernel socket layers, providing $O(1)$ routing, Layer 7 visibility, and transparent encryption.

### **104. What is a Kubernetes NetworkPolicy?**
**Answer:** A declarative firewall resource that controls traffic flow between Pods at Layer 3 and Layer 4 using label selectors.

### **105. What is a Default-Deny NetworkPolicy?**

## 🔴 **Part 3: Advanced Architectures & Production Troubleshooting (Questions 141–250)**

### **141. Scenario: A Pod is stuck in `CrashLoopBackOff`. Walk through your step-by-step diagnostic workflow.**
**Answer:**
1. Check Pod status and restart count: `kubectl get pod <name> -o wide`.
2. Inspect lifecycle events and exit codes: `kubectl describe pod <name>`.
3. Check application logs: `kubectl logs <name>`.
4. If the container crashed instantly, check previous crash logs: `kubectl logs <name> --previous`.
5. Common Root Causes: Missing environment variables/secrets, database connection timeouts, wrong command/entrypoint syntax, unhandled exception in initialization code.

### **142. Scenario: A Pod is terminated with `Exit Code 137`. What happened and how do you fix it?**
**Answer:**
- **Reason:** The container was killed by `SIGKILL` ($128 + 9 = 137$) sent by the Linux kernel Out-Of-Memory (OOM) Killer because physical memory usage exceeded the cgroup `limits.memory` threshold.
- **Diagnostics:** Verify via `kubectl describe pod` (look for `Last State: Terminated, Reason: OOMKilled`).
- **Fix:** Increase container memory limits, fix Java JVM heap flags (`-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75.0`), or profile application memory leaks using continuous profiling tools.

### **143. Scenario: A Pod is terminated with `Exit Code 143`. What happened?**
**Answer:** The container received a graceful `SIGTERM` signal ($128 + 15 = 143$) sent by Kubernetes during a rolling update, node drain, or HPA scale-down, and cleanly exited within the `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` window.

### **144. Scenario: A Pod is stuck in `ImagePullBackOff` / `ErrImagePull`. What are the common causes?**
**Answer:**
1. Incorrect image tag or typo in image repository URL.
2. Missing or misconfigured `imagePullSecrets` for authenticating to private registries.
3. Network timeout or firewall blocking egress from worker node to registry.
4. Hitting public Docker Hub rate limits (fixed via ECR Pull Through Cache).

### **145. Scenario: A Pod is stuck in `Pending` state. How do you identify the cause?**
**Answer:** Run `kubectl describe pod <name>` and check `Events`:
1. **Insufficient CPU / Memory:** No single worker node has enough unreserved capacity to satisfy the Pod's `requests`.
2. **NodeAffinity / Taints:** Pod lacks tolerations for tainted worker nodes.
3. **PVC Unbound:** PersistentVolumeClaim cannot bind to any available PV or StorageClass provisioner fails.
4. **NodeSelector Mismatch:** No nodes match the requested labels.

### **146. Scenario: A Pod is stuck in `Terminating` state for hours. How do you safely resolve it?**
**Answer:**
1. Check for blocking **Finalizers**: `kubectl get pod <name> -o jsonpath='{.metadata.finalizers}'`.
2. Check if a CSI volume unmount is hanging on a dead worker node.
3. If node is dead and volume is safe, remove finalizer or force delete: `kubectl delete pod <name> --grace-period=0 --force`.

### **147. Scenario: Explain the Linux `ndots:5` DNS resolution issue in Kubernetes and how it causes latency storms.**
**Answer:**
- By default, `/etc/resolv.conf` inside pods sets `options ndots:5`.
- If a query has fewer than 5 dots (e.g., `api.stripe.com` has 2 dots), the resolver sequentially appends all search domains:
  1. `api.stripe.com.default.svc.cluster.local` (NXDOMAIN)
  2. `api.stripe.com.svc.cluster.local` (NXDOMAIN)
  3. `api.stripe.com.cluster.local` (NXDOMAIN)
  4. `api.stripe.com` (SUCCESS)
- **Impact:** Generates 3 failed queries per external lookup, overwhelming CoreDNS.
- **Fix:** Deploy **NodeLocal DNSCache**, set `ndots:2` in pod `dnsConfig`, or append a trailing dot (`api.stripe.com.`).

### **148. Scenario: How do you achieve Zero-Downtime deployments for high-throughput HTTP services during rolling updates?**
**Answer:**
1. **Add `preStop` Sleep:** Ingress controllers take 1–3 seconds to update iptables endpoints. Add a `preStop` hook (`sleep 5`) so the old pod continues servicing in-flight requests while being removed from endpoints.
2. **Handle `SIGTERM` Gracefully:** Ensure the application process intercepts `SIGTERM` and drains active HTTP connections.
3. **Configure Accurate Readiness Probes:** Ensure readiness probe fails only after connection draining starts.
4. **Tune Deployment Strategy:** Set `maxSurge: 25%` and `maxUnavailable: 0`.

### **226. What is Kubernetes Custom Resource Conversion Webhook?**
**Answer:** A webhook that converts Custom Resources between different schema versions (e.g., `v1alpha1` $\rightarrow$ `v1`) on-the-fly during API reads/writes.

### **227. What is Dynamic Client vs Typed Client in Kubernetes Go SDK?**
**Answer:**
- **Typed Client (`clientset`):** Works with compiled static Kubernetes Go structs.
- **Dynamic Client:** Works with unstructured JSON objects (`unstructured.Unstructured`), essential for managing arbitrary CRDs.

### **228. What is Informer / SharedInformer in Kubernetes Controllers?**
**Answer:** A local in-memory cache of API Server objects that watches etcd events and triggers event handler callbacks (`OnAdd`, `OnUpdate`, `OnDelete`) without polling the API Server.

### **229. What is Kubernetes Workqueue in Controller development?**
**Answer:** A thread-safe, rate-limiting queue that buffers reconcile requests and deduplicates multiple updates for the same object key.

### **230. What is a Reconcile Loop in Kubernetes?**
**Answer:** An idempotent function: `Reconcile(Request) -> (Result, error)` that compares current cluster state against desired state in Git/CRD and executes CRUD operations to bring them into alignment.

### **231. What is Optimistic Concurrency Control (`resourceVersion`)?**
**Answer:** Every object in etcd has a `resourceVersion`. When updating an object, the API Server rejects writes if the client's `resourceVersion` does not match etcd's current version (HTTP 409 Conflict).

### **232. What is Kubernetes Eventual Consistency in Control Loops?**
**Answer:** Controllers do not expect immediate state synchronization; they continuously retry failed operations until the system reaches desired state.

### **233. What is Kubernetes Subresource (`/status`, `/scale`)?**
**Answer:** Dedicated API endpoints for updating specific parts of an object (e.g., updating `/status` does not trigger spec mutating admission webhooks).

### **234. What is Kubernetes OwnerReferences and BlockOwnerDeletion?**
**Answer:** Metadata pointing a child object to its parent controller, ensuring garbage collection deletes child pods when parent deployments are deleted.

### **235. What is a Headless Service SRV Record?**
**Answer:** CoreDNS returns `SRV` records containing port numbers and hostnames for each named port of backing pods in a Headless Service.

### **236. What is Kubernetes Service Session Affinity (`ClientIP`)?**
**Answer:** Directing requests from the same client IP to the same backing pod replica for a configurable timeout duration (`sessionAffinityConfig.clientIP.timeoutSeconds`).

### **237. What is ExternalTrafficPolicy (`Cluster` vs `Local`)?**
**Answer:**
- `Cluster` (Default): Node receiving traffic SNATs packet and forwards to any node running backing pods (extra network hop, obscures client IP).
- `Local`: Node routes traffic *only* to local pods on the same node (preserves client source IP, zero extra hop, requires health check node ports).

### **238. What is Kubernetes Traffic Distribution (`PreferClose`)?**
**Answer:** Routing Service traffic to endpoints that are topologically closest to the caller (same node $\rightarrow$ same zone $\rightarrow$ same region), minimizing cross-AZ data transfer costs.

### **239. What is Kubernetes IPAM (IP Address Management)?**
**Answer:** The subsystem in CNI plugins responsible for allocating and tracking available IP address blocks for nodes and pods.

### **240. What is AWS VPC CNI Prefix Delegation?**
**Answer:** Allocating IPv4 `/28` subnets (16 IPs) to each ENI instead of individual secondary IPs, increasing the maximum number of pods per EC2 instance by over 4x.

### **241. What is Azure CNI vs Kubenet?**
**Answer:**
- **Azure CNI:** Every pod gets a real IP from the Azure VNet (fast, but consumes large VNet CIDR space).
- **Kubenet:** Pods get private IPs behind NAT; routes configured in Azure route tables.

### **242. What is Calico CNI eBPF Data Plane?**
**Answer:** Replaces standard Linux iptables routing with high-performance eBPF programs, providing native WireGuard encryption and scalable NetworkPolicies.

### **243. What is Cilium Transparent Encryption (WireGuard)?**
**Answer:** Automatically encrypting all node-to-node and pod-to-pod network traffic using kernel WireGuard with zero sidecar proxy overhead.

### **244. What is Kubernetes Node Autoscaling Overprovisioning?**
**Answer:** Running dummy pause pods with low `PriorityClass` that hold reserve compute capacity. When real pods schedule, they preempt the pause pods, launching immediately while nodes scale in the background.

### **245. What is Kubernetes Mixed Instance Policy in Karpenter?**
**Answer:** Configuring Karpenter to dynamically mix diverse EC2 instance types, sizes, and generations across Spot and On-Demand pools to maximize availability and minimize cost.

### **246. What is Kubernetes Multi-Cluster Service Discovery (MCS API)?**
**Answer:** A standardized Kubernetes API (`ServiceExport`, `ServiceImport`) allowing services in Cluster A to discover and communicate with services in Cluster B using `my-svc.my-ns.svc.clusterset.local`.

### **247. What is Submariner for Multi-Cluster Networking?**
**Answer:** An open-source tool creating direct IPsec/WireGuard VPN tunnels between pods in disparate Kubernetes clusters across clouds and data centers.

### **248. What is Kyverno Image Signature Verification with Sigstore?**
**Answer:** An admission policy rule that verifies container image cryptographic signatures against Rekor transparency logs before allowing pods to schedule.

### **249. What is Falco eBPF System Call Monitoring?**
**Answer:** A CNCF security tool that intercepts kernel system calls (`execve`, `openat`, `socket`) to detect anomalous runtime behavior (shell spawning, privilege escalation) inside containers.

### **250. What is Kubernetes Hard Multi-Tenancy Architecture?**
**Answer:** Combining **`vcluster`** (isolated control planes), **Cilium NetworkPolicies** (isolated L3-L7 networks), **gVisor / Kata Containers** (sandboxed kernel runtimes), and **ResourceQuotas** to run untrusted multi-tenant workloads safely on a shared physical cluster.
